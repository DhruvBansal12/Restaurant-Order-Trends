# Restaurant-Order-Trends
Restaurant Order Trends Dashboard
Overview

This project is a full-stack analytics dashboard designed for restaurants. It helps track and analyze order patterns, giving managers real-time insights into how their restaurants are performing. The dashboard makes it easy to monitor daily orders, revenue trends, busy hours, and compare performance across multiple locations.

It’s especially useful for restaurant chains, management teams, or businesses with multiple outlets that need a single place to view and manage their operations.

System Architecture
Frontend

Built with React + TypeScript (SPA): A modern, single-page app with a clean, component-based structure.

Routing: Uses Wouter for fast, lightweight page navigation.

State Management: Powered by TanStack Query (React Query) for caching, background updates, and smooth data handling.

UI Components: Built using shadcn/ui and Radix UI, ensuring accessibility, responsive layouts, and a professional look.

Styling: Managed with Tailwind CSS, supporting themes (dark/light mode) via CSS variables.

Backend

Express.js REST API: Provides structured endpoints for restaurants, orders, and analytics data.

Route Organization: Clear, resource-based API structure with proper status codes.

Error Handling: Centralized middleware for consistent error responses and easier debugging.

Developer Experience: Integrated with Vite for hot reloading and faster local development.

Data Layer

PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM: Type-safe queries with schema-based TypeScript support.

Connection Management: Uses Neon’s serverless PostgreSQL with pooling for scalability.

Schema Design: Normalized tables for restaurants and orders, with strong data integrity for financial tracking.

Migrations: Managed through Drizzle Kit for versioned, reliable database changes.

Key Dependencies

Neon Database: Serverless PostgreSQL with scaling, pooling, and branching.

Chart.js: For interactive graphs (line, bar, doughnut charts).

React Hook Form + Zod: Form handling with validation for clean, error-free data.

Date-fns: For time-based analytics and formatting.

Radix UI Primitives: Accessible, keyboard- and screen reader–friendly components.

Tailwind CSS: Utility-first styling for fast and consistent UI design.
